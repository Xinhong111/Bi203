In this case ,the independent samples made by a regular MCMC chain should at most be a half of the total samples. \n",

Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic is important because if one has a distribution which have multiple smooth 'peaks' but are far away from each other, MCMC sampler might just well sample one or some of the peaks. In all those cases, we cannot sample a distribution with a finite number of MCMC steps."
