    "\n",
    "What is the difference between the prior distribution and posterior distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior distribution is how we think a parameter might be distributed before we get any data, and the posterior distribution is how the parameter is distributed given some data."

    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are prior predictive checks an important step in the process of building a generative model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior predictive checks are important because we should make sure that our model can produce datasets that make sense and that they represent what we believe about the generative process."

    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it necessary to compute summaries of the posterior? In other words, why can't we just write down the posterior (which is what the process of building a model is anyway) and be done with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe so we can visualize it and see if it's reasonable?"

    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing parameter estimation by optimization, after we find the MAP, why do we locally approximate the posterior near the MAP as a (possibly multivariate) Gaussian?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAP reduces all the information into a single point so we don't know anything about the distribution, and then we approximate it using Gaussians, which are easy to work with?"
