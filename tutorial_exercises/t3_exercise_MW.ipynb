    "To answer this question, try to match these stories to the stories of named distributions. For those of you not familiar with baseball, a no-hitter is a game in which a team concedes no hits to the opposing team. There have only been a few hundred no-hitters in over 200,000 MLB games. The Belmont Stakes is a major horse race that has been run each year for over 150 years."

In both cases I felt like I should've already had some knowledge in these distributions, so it was hard for me to grasp what distributions corresponded to what kind of story. At the start of 3rd term last year, I didn't even know what distributions existed outside of Gaussian and Poisson...but that's one of the reasons I'm taking this class! I hope we can go into more detail and have more examples of these distributions so I can start to think about how to model certain types of events. \n",

I don't know how to rank the exponential distribution intuitively though.\n",
