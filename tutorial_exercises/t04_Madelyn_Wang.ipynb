    "What is **thresholding**, and what is it used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding is the process of converting an image into a binary image. It is used to mark certain regions as areas of interest and separate it from the background."

    "What is a **structuring element** and what is it used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "A structuring element is some shape that is used for filtering. It defines the region around a given pixel that is used in the processing of that pixel. It is used for filtering and cleaning up noise from images. "

    "\n",
    "How would you define an **edge** in an image? Describe how a Laplacian of Gaussian filter can be used to find edges in an image. Why can't we just use a Laplacian filter without the Gaussian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges mark differences in surfaces or textures or objects that would let us know where important objects are. At an edge, there will be a sharp gradient in the pixel values, which would give a zero-crossing when taking the second derivative. The Gaussian filter reduces noise in the image, and taking the Laplacian gives the second derivative, allowing us to find zero-crossings. It is necessary to use the Gaussian before using the Laplacian filter because noise will be greatly amplified in computing the second derivative. "
