We do play with two parameters a little bit: the size of structuring element and the range of the threshold ratio $k$. The biggest problem we encounter is the tails of bacteria showing up sometimes, so we try to decrease the size of structuring element, which does help but would also lead to some missing pixels inside bacteria. So we go with the 50 pixel radius disk as our structuring element, and tune down the ratio so that the pixels only with high enough contrast, i.e. here those whose intensity is significantly lower than the local mean, to eliminate the tail in segmented images. Due to the tail problem, we also try a similar way to automatically find a good threshold, but instead of comparing the pixel intensity with its local mean, we may compare it with some fixed values."

We did try other advanced edge finder functions, but they all did not work well probably due to the tail problem.

Hence, we decide to go with the basic threshold methods and choose best bacteria based on those images."
