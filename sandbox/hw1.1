Goal: Understand the logic underly varieties of data analysis method and apply them to my research in the lab

Context: Interested in understanding the interaction between neuron system and immune system, I am utilizing established imaging methods to record the real-time activity of neurons and try developing tools to genetically perturbed the function of immune cells. For the neuron part, I hope to apply the skills in signal extraction, denoising and image processing. And engineering AAV capsid by direct evolution is my main focus for tool development in immune system, which involves regression, parameters estimation and other skills.

Skills: Imaging processing , parameter estimation and Building Hierarchical Model. Tidy and analyze large dataset in a more efficient manner, also present them in a more elegant way.
