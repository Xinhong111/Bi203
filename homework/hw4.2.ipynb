The biggest problem we encounter is the tails of bacteria showing up sometimes, so we try to decrease the size of structuring element, which does help but would also lead to some missing pixels inside bacteria. So we go with the 50 pixel radius disk as our structuring element, and tune down the ratio so that the pixels only with high enough contrast, i.e. here those whose intensity is significantly lower than the local mean, to eliminate the tail in segmented images. Due to the tail problem, we also try a similar way to automatically find a good threshold, but instead of comparing the pixel intensity with its local mean, we may compare it with some fixed values."

But anyway, we think it is good enough for us to select bacteria for further analysis. We did try other advanced edge finder functions, but they all did not work well probably due to the tail problem. We suspect the reason is that no matter how we tune the parameters, those methods are mostly based on gradient, while the beginning parts of the tails usually have a similar gradient with bacterial bodies. Hence, we decide to go with the basic threshold methods and choose best bacteria based on those images."
